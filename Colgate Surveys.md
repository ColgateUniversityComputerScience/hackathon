# Colgate Surveys Project Overview

## Introduction
This project, named **Colgate Surveys**, was created by Jude Ramanan, Fausto De Leon, Hugo Stickney, and Alex Radovich for the 2024 Colgate Gate-Hacks.

## Our Goal
At Colgate, we observed a significant communication gap between the administration and the student body. Our project aims to bridge this divide by providing a straightforward user interface for faculty and students to engage in polls, thereby enhancing communication and community engagement.

## How It Works
**Colgate Surveys** operates on two fronts:
- **Client Side (Students):** Students can select an active poll, fill in their responses, and submit them to the database.
- **Admin Side (Faculty):** Administrators can create new polls, monitor ongoing ones, and delete outdated polls. When a poll is deleted, a random email is displayed, allowing the admin to contact the student for a prize.

## Development
The application was developed using Next.js (a React framework) and TailwindCSS, with a custom-built API for handling calls and updates to our MongoDB database, facilitated by Prisma. It's hosted locally using Ngrok.

## How to Use
Accessing the site is straightforward:
- **For Users:** Visit [https://tinyurl.com/CUGHSY](https://tinyurl.com/CUGHSY).
- **For Admins:** Use "admin" as both username and password to access the admin page.

## Difficulties and Challenges
Participating in our first hackathon, we encountered new challenges such as database management, full-stack development, HTTP servers, and learning new frameworks. Despite the steep learning curve, we gradually understood how the components worked together, leading to a more intuitive development process.

## Market Strategy
Our marketing strategy is to present this application directly to Colgate's administration. Future improvements would include enhancing the UI for better aesthetics and functionality, expanding the site's capabilities for use by other institutions, increasing security measures, and seeking a more stable hosting platform.
