# ClubGate

## Introduction
ClubGate is a comprehensive application designed to connect students with clubs and events at Colgate University. It addresses the common issue of being overwhelmed at club fairs or missing club events due to lack of information. Unlike the existing GetInvolved platform, which is often outdated, ClubGate offers an up-to-date and user-friendly solution for both students and club leaders.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Club Listings:** Organized by type (Arts, Music, Science, etc.) with contact information and event details.
- **Personalized Club Management:** Track the clubs you're a part of and view their upcoming events.
- **Dynamic Event Calendar:** Interactive calendar displaying events from clubs you follow.
- **Effective Communication Tools:** In-app messaging for announcements and direct communication.

## Development
The application is developed entirely in Java, utilizing the JFrame class to create a user interface with buttons, scroll panels, and other interactive elements. The development journey began with design prototypes in Figma but eventually transitioned to direct coding in Java for both front-end and back-end functionalities.

### User Interface
- **Login and Registration:** Secure entry point with validation checks.
- **Home Screen:** Displays upcoming events with navigation to different app sections.
- **Club Listings and Personal Clubs:** Accessible lists of all clubs and those you are part of.
- **Notifications and Profile Management:** Direct messaging and user profile customization.

## Challenges
- Transitioning from design tools like Figma to hand-coding the entire application in Java.
- Implementing user authentication and data management without relying on external databases.

## Potential
ClubGate has the versatility to be implemented at any educational institution, facilitating better engagement and management of extracurricular activities. Its intuitive design and comprehensive features make it a valuable tool for students seeking to enhance their campus life.
