# Simultaneous Noise

A basic Android WebView application that plays white noise independently of other media, such as music and podcasts. It includes a sleep timer function for convenience.

## Features

- Plays white noise independently of other media playback on the device.
- Includes a sleep timer function.
- Fully self-contained with no need for internet, filesystem, or extensive permissions.

## Credits

Noise player functionality is derived from [Soothy](https://codeberg.org/ltguillaume/soothy) by ltGuillaume. The app is encapsulated in a simple WebView, utilizing code from [Joshua Tzucker's WebView template](https://joshuatz.com/posts/2021/webviewassetloader-webviewclient-kotlin/).

## To-Do

- Implement independent volume control for noises.
- Address potential compatibility issues between virtual and physical Android devices.
- Perform code cleanup and optimization, especially since this is an early venture into Android coding.
