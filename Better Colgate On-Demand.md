# Better Colgate On-Demand

Colgate is in the middle of nowhere, making it difficult to get around due to limited transportation. The on-demand shuttle service is provided for trips to airports and train stations, but tracking the availability of shuttles, the number of passengers, and estimated prices is challenging. Furthermore, changing information or communicating is cumbersome because the service mainly relies on email and phone calls.

We aim to create a web app that enhances transparency and eases navigation of trip details and reservations. This will ideally be utilized by Colgate on-demand scheduling to ensure more accessible and convenient shuttle services and improve user experience.

### Purpose & Motivation
Our motivation for developing Colgate On-Demand is to improve the accessibility and manageability of transportation services at Colgate. We aimed to create a user-friendly platform that would streamline the booking process, offer real-time updates on shuttle schedules, and accommodate the dynamic transportation needs of our community.

### Development of the Application
The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and Figma, with an emphasis on interactive experiences. We focused mainly on the frontend system for managing reservations, user accounts, and trip schedules. Development phases included planning, designing the user interface, and implementing front-end interactivity.

### How the Application Works
Colgate On-Demand allows users to view available shuttle services, join existing trips, and book new reservations. Upon accessing the application, users can:

- Browse the "Shuttle Schedule" to find upcoming trips.
- Click "Join" on a current trip to use a pre-filled booking form with trip details, eliminating the need to create a new reservation.
- Use the "Book Now" feature to create new reservations with custom itineraries.
- Manage their bookings through the "Account" section, where past trips and user details are displayed.

### Difficulty
- The main challenge we experienced is the limited time, preventing us from integrating real-time scheduling data with the application.
- We realized that we lack experience in backend development to store and retrieve data, so we focused more on illustrating the interactive user experiences in the "Prototype" track.

### Go-to-Market Strategy
Colgate On-Demand will be launched through the university's web portal, making it readily accessible to the campus community. Marketing strategies include email campaigns, informational booths, and collaboration with student organizations. The application is designed to be scalable, with the potential to expand services based on user demand and feedback, ensuring it remains a vital resource for campus transportation.
