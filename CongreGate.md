## Overview

CongreGate is a project launched at GateHacks 2024, aimed at monitoring student flow in and out of Frank Dining Hall at Colgate University. This initiative helps students decide the optimal time to visit the dining hall and could be expanded to other locations like the Coop, Huntington Gym, and Case-Geyer Library for a quieter and more enjoyable experience.

## Purpose

CongreGate was developed to solve the common problem of overcrowded campus facilities. By providing real-time data on the number of people at various locations, students can make informed decisions and avoid busy times, leading to a more pleasant campus experience.

## How It Works

CongreGate utilizes ultrasonic distance sensors to track entrances and exits, with data transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop. This information is then updated on a web application, showing the current count of people and the last update time.

## Future Directions

The vision for CongreGate includes:
- Enhancing sensor accuracy and expanding to more campus locations.
- Developing software to support additional sites and multi-floor facilities.
- Analyzing long-term occupancy data to predict peak times.
- Creating a mobile application for easy access.
